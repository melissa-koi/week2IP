# Akan Name Generator

This is a web application that is inspired by the Ghanian culture. In Ghana the first name given to a newborn baby is solely dependent on the day of the week he/she is born and their gender.This name is known as the Akan name. The website i have created enables one to get an Akan name after input of their birthdate and gender. Thanks to the capabalities of javascript ,the webpage is able to use the input provided to compute a name.
